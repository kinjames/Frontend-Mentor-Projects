<h1 align="center">Frontend Mentor Challenges</h1>

<p>
This repository contains lists of projects that I completed from Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenge helps to improve coding skills by making you build realistic projects. Each project has it own challenge that helps to improve on the various aspects of Frontend Development. I have categorized them into 5 categories that is Newbie, Junior, Intermediate, Advanced and Guru.
Underneath each project is a picture, a link that directs you to the repository of the project, a live site link and also the technologies used in building such project or solving such challenge. Don't hesitate to contact me if you encounter a problem with one of the codes or have a different method or idea to simplify the code. My contact is at the end of this README file. I'm open to learn new things and open for collaborations. Scroll through and Enjoy!!
